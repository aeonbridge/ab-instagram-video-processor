## Video Transcript

don't see it and i love how it sounds now audio makes up for 50 of the video viewing experience so you want to make sure that you get good audio but it doesn't have to break the bank like mine now when it comes to the camera setup i'm so pumped because you already know i love the sony zve10 this is a compact 4k camera that shoots great video and has incredible autofocus and you never have to worry about being out of focus and i have a continuous power adapter so i don't have to worry about batteries which is a very smart investment if you don't want your batteries to die but we've made tons of videos on this camera it's totally one of my favorites especially for just simple videos as far as the lens goes i got the infamous sigma 16 millimeter lens and this lens gives you a perfect medium wide shot so
