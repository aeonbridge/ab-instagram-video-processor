  "content": "Source: https://docs.agno.com/introduction\n\n**Agno is an incredibly fast multi-agent framework, runtime and control plane.**\n\nCompanies want to build AI products, add AI to existing products and automate workflows with agents. Doing this well takes far more than calling an LLM API. It requires a thoughtfully designed agentic platform.\n\nAgno provides the complete stack to build, run and manage multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Framework**: Build agents, multi-agent teams and workflows with memory, knowledge, state, guardrails, HITL, context compression, MCP, A2A and 100+ toolkits.\n* **AgentOS Runtime**: Run your multi-agent system in production with a secure, stateless runtime and ready to use integration endpoints.\n* **AgentOS Control Plane**: Test, monitor and manage AgentOS deployments across environments with full operational visibility.\n\nHere’s an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages conversation state in a database, is served using a FastAPI application that you can chat using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).\n\n```python agno_agent.py lines theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.anthropic import Claude\nfrom agno.os import AgentOS\nfrom agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools",
