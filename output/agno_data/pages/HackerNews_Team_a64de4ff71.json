This example combines multiple specialized agents to research topics, read articles, and generate comprehensive summaries with structured output.\n\nBy building this team, you'll understand:\n\n* How to integrate multiple data sources (HackerNews API, web search, article readers)\n* How to define structured output schemas using Pydantic models\n* How to coordinate agents with specific instructions for complex workflows\n* How to combine real-time data with web research for comprehensive analysis\n\nBuild news aggregation platforms, trend analysis systems, content curation tools, or automated newsletter generators.\n\nThe team coordinates three specialized agents to create detailed articles:\n\n1. **Discover**: HackerNews researcher finds trending stories from HackerNews\n2. **Read**: Article reader extracts full content from story URLs\n3. **Research**: Web searcher finds additional context and related information\n4. **Synthesize**: Team combines all findings into structured articles with summaries and references\n\nThe team outputs structured data following a defined schema with title, summary, and reference links.\n\nThe team will research HackerNews stories, read the full articles, and search for additional context. Each agent contributes their specialized capability: finding stories, extracting article content, and web research.\n\nThe output is a structured Article object with a title, comprehensive summary, and reference links. You'll see responses from all team members showing how they collaborate to gather and synthesize information.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Snippet file=\"create-venv-step.mdx\" />\n\n<Step title=\"Set your API key\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Install libraries\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Run Team\">\n    <CodeGroup>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n* Modify the query to track specific topics or keywords on HackerNews\n* Adjust the `Article` schema to include additional fields like categories or sentiment\n* Change the number of stories analyzed in the prompt\n* Explore [Input & Output](/basics/input-output/overview) for custom data schemas",
