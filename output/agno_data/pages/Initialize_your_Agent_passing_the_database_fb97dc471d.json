They won't remember previous conversations.\n\n  But in production environments, you will often need to continue the same session across multiple requests. Storage is the way to persist the session history and state in a database, enabling you and your users to pick up where you left off.\n\n  Storage also lets us inspect and evaluate Agent sessions, extract few-shot examples and build internal monitoring tools. In general, it lets you **keep track of the data**, to build better Agents.\n</Tip>\n\n### Adding session history to the context\n\nAgents backed by a database persist their [sessions](/basics/sessions/overview) to it. You can then load this persisted history into the context to maintain continuity across sessions.",
