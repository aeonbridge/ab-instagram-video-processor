For example, if you say \"Generate an image of a dog and tell me\n  its color.\" the model will have access to the image and can use it to describe\n  the dog's color in the response in the same run.\n\nThat also means you can ask follow-up questions about the image, since it would be available in the history of the agent.\n</Check>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n* View more [Examples](/basics/multimodal/images/usage/generate-image)",
