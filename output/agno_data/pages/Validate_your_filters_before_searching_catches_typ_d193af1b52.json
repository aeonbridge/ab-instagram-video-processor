It'll tell you if processing failed or is still in progress.\n</Tip>\n\n## Automatic vs Manual Search\n\nAgno gives you two ways to use knowledge with agents:\n\n**Agentic Search** (`search_knowledge=True`):\nThe agent automatically decides when to search and what to look for. This is the recommended approach for most use cases - it's smarter and more dynamic.\n\n**Traditional RAG** (`add_knowledge_to_context=True`):\nRelevant knowledge is always added to the agent's context. Simpler but less flexible. Use this when you want predictable, consistent behavior.",
