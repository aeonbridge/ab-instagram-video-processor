State is managed through `session_state`, which can be accessed and updated in tools, then automatically persisted to your database.\n\nState in Agno follows this pattern:\n\n1. **Initialize** - Set default `session_state` when creating agents, teams, or workflows\n2. **Access** - Tools access state via `run_context.session_state`\n3. **Update** - Modifications are automatically persisted to the database\n4. **Load** - Subsequent runs in the same session retrieve the stored state\n\nHere's a simple agent that maintains a shopping list:\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Agent State\" icon=\"robot\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/state/agent\">\n    Learn about state in agents.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Team State\" icon=\"users\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/state/team\">\n    Learn about state in teams.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Workflow State\" icon=\"diagram-project\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/state/workflows/overview\">\n    Learn about state in workflows.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n* View the [Agent schema](/reference/agents/agent)\n* View the [Team schema](/reference/teams/team)\n* View the [Workflow schema](/reference/workflows/workflow)\n* View the [RunContext schema](/reference/run/run-context)",
