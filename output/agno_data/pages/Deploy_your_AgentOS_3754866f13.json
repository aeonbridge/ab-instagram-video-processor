AgentOS exposes a FastAPI application under the hood, which means you are free to deploy it to any infrastructure you prefer, including container services, serverless architectures, Kubernetes, or a simple virtual machine.\n\nThe most reliable and convenient way to deploy a FastAPI application to production is with Docker. To make this easy, we provide ready-to-use templates for popular platforms including AWS ECS and Railway with more coming soon. If you prefer complete control, you can also turn your AgentOS into a minimal production repository with just a few files.\n\nHere, we'll walk you through the entire process: starting from a plain Python codebase, converting it into a production-ready FastAPI service, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it to the platform of your choice.\n\n## Preparing your Python project\n\nA minimal AgentOS project usually looks like this:\n\nYour agents, teams and workflows are automatically mounted and ready to serve. As long as they are added to your AgentOS instance.\n\n## Adding a production ready Dockerfile\n\nHere is a minimal Dockerfile for deploying AgentOS:\n\nThis creates a clean, production-friendly container image.\n\nBuild and run the container using the following commands from the root of your project:\n\n* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n* [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n* [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno)\n\nVisit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see your AgentOS documentation. Here you can see the endpoints for your AgentOS.\n\n## Deployment options\n\nYou can deploy AgentOS anywhere that supports Docker containers.\\\nTo get started quickly, we recommend using one of our deployment templates.\\\nLearn more about them [here](/deploy/templates).\n\nA production-ready configuration running entirely on AWS:\n\n* Multi-architecture Docker builds\n* Amazon ECR for container registry\n* ECS Fargate service for running your container\n* Application Load Balancer with HTTPS\n* Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)\n\nCheck out our [AWS template](/templates/agent-infra-aws/introduction) for more information.\n\nAgentOS can run on any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. For example:\n\n* Google Cloud Run\n* AWS App Runner\n* Azure Container Apps\n\nA simple and fast deployment method. Railway:\n\n* Builds your Dockerfile\n* Manages environment variables\n* Provides a public HTTPS domain automatically\n\nCheck out our [Railway template](/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction) for more information.\n\n### Hosting Platforms\n\nSimilar to Railway, you can use other platforms that accept a Dockerfile, manage environment variables, and host your service with minimal configuration.\\\nTemplates for these are coming soon:\n\n* [Modal](https://modal.com/)\n* [Render](https://render.com/)\n* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n* [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)\n\nReady to deploy?\\\nChoose one of our templates to get started quickly and run AgentOS in production with minimal setup.\n\n<Card title=\"Explore all Templates\" icon=\"robot\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/deploy/templates\">\n  Explore all templates and get started quickly.\n</Card>",
