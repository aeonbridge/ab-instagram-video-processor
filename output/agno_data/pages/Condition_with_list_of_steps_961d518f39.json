Shows how to create sophisticated branching\nlogic with complex multi-step sequences based on content analysis.\n\n**When to use**: When different topics or content types require completely different\nprocessing pipelines. Ideal for adaptive workflows where the research methodology\nshould change based on the subject matter or complexity requirements.\n\n```python condition_with_list_of_steps.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.exa import ExaTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.condition import Condition\nfrom agno.workflow.parallel import Parallel\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepInput\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
