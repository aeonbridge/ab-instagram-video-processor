Each agent\nhas specific reasoning responsibilities to ensure thorough analysis.\n\nTeam Composition:\n- Information Gatherer: Searches knowledge base and gathers raw information\n- Reasoning Analyst: Applies logical reasoning to analyze gathered information\n- Evidence Evaluator: Evaluates evidence quality and identifies gaps\n- Response Coordinator: Synthesizes everything into a final reasoned response\n\nSetup:\n1. Run: `pip install agno anthropic cohere lancedb tantivy sqlalchemy`\n2. Export your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and CO_API_KEY\n3.
