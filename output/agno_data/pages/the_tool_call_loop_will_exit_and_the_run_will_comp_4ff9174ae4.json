The tool call loop exits immediately, and the run completes with status `COMPLETED`. All session state, messages, and tool calls up to that point are stored in the database.\n\n<Tip>\n  Make sure to set `AGNO_DEBUG=True` if you want to see the debug logs.\n</Tip>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n* View the [RetryAgentRun schema](/reference/tools/retry-agent-run)\n* View the [StopAgentRun schema](/reference/tools/stop-agent-run)\n* View [Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/tools/exceptions)",
