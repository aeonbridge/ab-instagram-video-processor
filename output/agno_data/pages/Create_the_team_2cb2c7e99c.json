Members with an explicitly assigned `model` retain their own. In nested team structures, inheritance always happens from the direct parent.\n  Teams without a defined model default to OpenAI `gpt-4o`.\n\n  The `reasoning_model`, `parser_model`, and `output_model` must be explicitly defined for each team or team member.\n\n  See the [model inheritance example](/basics/teams/usage/other/model-inheritance).\n</Note>\n\n## Run your Team\n\nWhen running your team, use the `Team.print_response()` method to print the response in the terminal.\n\nYou can pass `show_members_responses=True` to also print the responses from the team members.\n\nFor example:",
