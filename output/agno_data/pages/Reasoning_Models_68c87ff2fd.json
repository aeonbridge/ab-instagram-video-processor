They produce a long internal chain of thought before responding.\n\nExamples of reasoning models include:\n\n* OpenAI o1-pro and gpt-5-mini\n* Claude 3.7 sonnet in extended-thinking mode\n* Gemini 2.0 flash thinking\n* DeepSeek-R1\n\nReasoning models deeply consider and think through a plan before taking action. Its all about what the model does **before it starts generating a response**. Reasoning models excel at single-shot use-cases. They're perfect for solving hard problems (coding, math, physics) that don't require multiple turns, or calling tools sequentially.\n\n```python gpt_5_mini.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat",
