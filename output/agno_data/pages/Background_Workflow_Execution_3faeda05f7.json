This returns a `WorkflowRunOutput` object with a `run_id` for polling the workflow status until completion.\n\n<Note>\n  Background execution requires async workflows using `.arun()`. Poll for results using `workflow.get_run(run_id)` and check completion status with `.has_completed()`.\n\nIdeal for long-running operations like large-scale data processing, multi-step research, or batch operations that shouldn't block your main application thread.\n</Note>\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
