      "code": "<Note>\n  **Smart Defaults**: Agno provides sensible defaults to get you started quickly:\n\n  * **Embedder**: If no embedder is specified, Agno automatically uses `OpenAIEmbedder` with default settings\n  * **Chunking**: If no chunking strategy is provided to readers, Agno defaults to `FixedSizeChunking(chunk_size=5000)`\n  * **Search Type**: Vector databases default to `SearchType.vector` for semantic search\n\n  This means you can start with minimal configuration and customize as needed!\n</Note>\n\n### What Happens When You Add Content\n\nWhen you call `knowledge.add_content()`, here's what happens:\n\n1. **A reader parses your file** - Agno picks the right reader (PDFReader, CSVReader, WebsiteReader, etc.) based on your file type and extracts the text\n2. **Content gets chunked** - Your chosen chunking strategy breaks the text into digestible pieces, whether by semantic boundaries, fixed sizes, or document structure\n3. **Embeddings are created** - Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using your embedder (OpenAI, SentenceTransformer, etc.)\n4. **Status is tracked** - Content moves through states: PROCESSING → COMPLETED or FAILED\n5. **Everything is stored** - Chunks, embeddings, and metadata all land in your vector database, ready for search\n\n### What Happens During a Conversation\n\nWhen your agent receives a question:\n\n1. **The agent decides** - Should I search for more context or answer from what I already know?\n2. **Query gets embedded** - If searching, your question becomes a vector using the same embedder\n3. **Similar chunks are found** - `knowledge.search()` or `knowledge.async_search()` finds chunks with vectors close to your question\n4. **Filters are applied** - Any metadata filters you configured narrow down the results\n5. **Agent synthesizes the answer** - Retrieved context + your question = accurate, grounded response\n\n## Key Components Working Together\n\n* **Readers** - Agno's reader factory provides specialized parsers: PDFReader, CSVReader, WebsiteReader, MarkdownReader, and more for different content types.\n\n* **Chunking Strategies** - Choose from FixedSizeChunking, SemanticChunking, or RecursiveChunking to optimize how documents are broken down for search.\n\n* **Embedders** - Support for OpenAIEmbedder, SentenceTransformerEmbedder, and other embedding models to convert text into searchable vectors.\n\n* **Contents Database** - A table in your database that keeps track of what content you've added to your Knowledge base.\n\n* **Vector Databases** - PgVector for production, LanceDB for development, or PineconeDB for managed services - each with hybrid search capabilities.\n\n## Choosing Your Chunking Strategy\n\nHow you split content dramatically affects search quality. Agno gives you several strategies to match your content type:\n\n* **Fixed Size** - Splits at consistent character counts. Fast and predictable, great for uniform content\n* **Semantic** - Uses embeddings to find natural topic boundaries. Best for complex docs where meaning matters\n* **Recursive** - Respects document structure (paragraphs, sections). Good balance of speed and context\n* **Document** - Preserves natural document divisions. Perfect for well-structured content\n* **CSV Row** - Treats each row as a unit. Essential for tabular data\n* **Markdown** - Honors heading hierarchy. Ideal for documentation\n\nLearn more about [choosing the right chunking strategy](/basics/knowledge/chunking/overview) for your use case.\n\n## Managing Your Knowledge Base\n\nOnce content is loaded, you'll want to check status, search, and manage what's there:",
