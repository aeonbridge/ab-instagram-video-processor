It could be a todo list, the user's profile, or anything else.\n\nWhen this data needs to remain accessible across runs, or needs to be updated during the session, you want to consider it **session state**.\n\nSession state is accessible from tool calls, pre-hooks and post-hooks, and other functions that are part of the Agent run. You are also able to use it in the system message, to ultimately present it to the Model.\n\nSession state is also persisted in the database, if one is available to the Agent, and is automatically loaded when the session is continued.\n\n<Note>\n  **Understanding Agent \"Statelessness\"**: Agents in Agno don't maintain working state directly on the `Agent` object in memory. Instead they provide state management capabilities:\n\n* The `session.get_session_state(session_id=session_id)` method retrieves the session state of a particular session from the database\n  * The `session_state` parameter on `Agent` provides the **default** state data for new sessions\n  * Working state is managed per run and persisted to the database per session\n  * The agent instance (or attributes thereof) itself is not modified during runs\n</Note>\n\nNow that we understand what session state is, let's see how it works:\n\n* You can set the Agent's `session_state` parameter with a dictionary of default state variables. This will be the initial state.\n* You can pass `session_state` to `agent.run()`. This will take precedence over the Agent's default state for that run.\n* You can access the session state in tool calls and other functions, via `run_context.session_state`.\n* The `session_state` will be stored in your database. Subsequent runs **within the same session** will load the state from the database. See the [guide](/basics/state/agent#maintaining-state-across-multiple-runs-within-a-session) for more information.\n* You can use any data in your `session_state` in the system message, by referencing it in the `description` and `instructions` parameters. See the [guide](/basics/state/agent#using-state-in-instructions) for more information.\n* You can have your Agent automatically update the session state by setting the `enable_agentic_state` parameter to `True`. See the [guide](/basics/state/agent#agentic-session-state) for more information.\n\nHere's an example where an Agent is managing a shopping list:\n\n```python session_state.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.run import RunContext",
