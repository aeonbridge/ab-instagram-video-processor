But if you're seeing slow searches, memory issues, or poor results, a few strategic changes can make a big difference.\n\nAvoid premature optimization. Focus on performance when the system shows:\n\n* **Slow search** - Queries taking more than 2-3 seconds\n* **Memory issues** - Out of memory errors during content loading\n* **Poor results** - Search returning irrelevant chunks or missing obvious matches\n* **Slow loading** - Content processing taking unusually long\n\nIf things are working fine, stick with the defaults and focus on building your application.\n\n## The 80/20 of Performance\n\nThese five changes give you the biggest performance boost for the least effort:\n\n### 1. Pick the Right Vector Database\n\nDatabase choice has the biggest impact on performance at scale:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb\nfrom agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector",
