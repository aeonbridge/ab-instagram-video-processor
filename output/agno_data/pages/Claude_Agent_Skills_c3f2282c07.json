These will be loaded on demand, removing the need to provide the same guidance multiple times as it happens with prompts.\n\nYou can read more about how **Skills** work on [Anthropic docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work).\n\n* **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create professional presentations with slides, layouts, and formatting\n* **Excel (xlsx)**: Generate spreadsheets with formulas, charts, and data analysis\n* **Word (docx)**: Create and edit documents with rich formatting\n* **PDF (pdf)**: Analyze and extract information from PDF documents\n\nYou can also create custom skills for Claude to use. You can read more about that on [Anthropic docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#custom-skills-examples).\n\nBefore using Claude Agent Skills, ensure you have:\n\n1. **Python 3.8 or higher**\n2. **Anthropic API key** with access to Claude models\n3. **Beta access** to Claude Agent Skills\n\n## File Download Helper Setup\n\n<Warning>\n  **Important:** Files created by Agent Skills are NOT automatically saved to your local filesystem. They are created in a sandboxed execution environment and must be downloaded using the Anthropic Files API.\n\nBefore running any of the examples below, you must create the `file_download_helper.py` file in the same directory as your script.\n</Warning>\n\n### How File Download Works\n\n1. Claude creates the file in the sandbox\n2. Returns a **file ID** in the tool result\n3. You download the file using the helper function below\n\n### Create `file_download_helper.py`\n\nSave the following code as `file_download_helper.py` in your project directory:\n\nOnce you've created this file, you can import it in your scripts:\n\nEnable skills by passing them to the Claude model configuration:\n\nThe framework automatically:\n\n* Configures the required betas (`code-execution-2025-08-25`, `skills-2025-10-02`)\n* Adds the code execution tool\n* Uses the beta API client\n* Sets up the container with skill configurations\n\nYou can enable multiple skills at once:\n\nCreate professional presentations with slides, layouts, and formatting.\n\n### Example: Q4 Business Review Presentation\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport os\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.anthropic import Claude\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\nfrom file_download_helper import download_skill_files",
