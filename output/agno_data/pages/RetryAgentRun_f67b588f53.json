The exception message is passed to the model as a tool call error, allowing the model to adjust its approach in the next iteration of the LLM loop.\n\n<Note>\n  This does **not** retry the full agent run—it only provides feedback to the model within the current run's tool call loop.\n</Note>\n\n<ResponseField name=\"exc\" type=\"str\" required>\n  The error message to pass to the model. This message provides instructions or feedback to help the model adjust its behavior in the next iteration.\n</ResponseField>\n\n<ResponseField name=\"user_message\" type=\"Union[str, Message]\" optional>\n  An optional message to display to the user about the retry.\n</ResponseField>\n\n<ResponseField name=\"agent_message\" type=\"Union[str, Message]\" optional>\n  An optional message from the agent's perspective about the retry.\n</ResponseField>\n\n<ResponseField name=\"messages\" type=\"List[Union[dict, Message]]\" optional>\n  An optional list of messages to add to the conversation history.\n</ResponseField>\n\nUse `RetryAgentRun` when:\n\n* **Validation fails**: Input doesn't meet requirements, and you want the model to try again with corrected input\n* **State requirements**: The current state doesn't meet prerequisites, and you want the model to perform additional actions\n* **Business logic**: A condition isn't met, and you want to guide the model on how to proceed\n* **Iterative refinement**: You want the model to improve its approach based on feedback\n\nWhen `RetryAgentRun` is raised:\n\n1. The exception message is added to the tool call result as an error\n2. The model receives this error in the next LLM call\n3. The model can adjust its approach and retry the tool call or try a different approach\n4. The agent run continues (does not stop or exit)\n5. All messages and tool calls are preserved in the session\n\n* [StopAgentRun Exception](/reference/tools/stop-agent-run)\n* [Exceptions & Retries Guide](/basics/tools/exceptions)",
