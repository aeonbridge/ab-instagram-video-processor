The top level of the `Team` is called the \"team leader\".\n\nBelow is a minimal example of a language-routing team with two agents and one sub-team.\n\n<img className=\"block dark:hidden\" src=\"https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=0bbb6a84e04b9201746b0ff3495243e3\" alt=\"Team structure\" data-og-width=\"2610\" width=\"2610\" data-og-height=\"1413\" height=\"1413\" data-path=\"images/teams/team-structure-light.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=d9ca1e24c2099dffd88f2578e270dfa3 280w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=2a02ea12563bb86e4abb675612f9798a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=638794030f685b82d26b434bb29e965f 840w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=6af9acfb6c2a82818deb979daee38365 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=5b3eaa00ec569867483b304a98d6be0d 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-light.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=5a153a9a9cd31794ab9f53a82324537f 2500w\" />\n\n<img className=\"hidden dark:block\" src=\"https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=c4a60d21db7ffcd568b1d40c6eeb6866\" alt=\"Team structure\" data-og-width=\"2610\" width=\"2610\" data-og-height=\"1413\" height=\"1413\" data-path=\"images/teams/team-structure-dark.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=c44983dd9d8421469118ab7754a31852 280w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=6737f538162e1f95fffc78f71de32ae4 560w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=53c06595fc0177b71e828771431ff9c7 840w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=7874c16f789718d6dd7333d40bf36290 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=d83b756d8d1effc8825882a5f39ce86f 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/agno-v2/i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd/images/teams/team-structure-dark.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=i4nXCaAsJR5zgHQd&q=85&s=08ae74854289473571437318aee88b55 2500w\" />\n\n<Note>\n  It is highly recommended to first learn more about [Agents](/basics/agents/overview) before diving into Teams.\n</Note>\n\nThe team leader delegates tasks to members depending on the role of the members and the nature of the tasks.  See the [Delegation](/basics/teams/delegation) guide for more details.\n\nAs with agents, teams support the following features:\n\n* **Model:** Set the model that is used by the \"team leader\" to delegate tasks to the team members.\n* **Instructions:** Instruct the team leader on how to solve problems. The names, descriptions and roles of team members are automatically provided to the team leader.\n* **Database:** The Team's session history and state is stored in a database. This enables your team to continue conversations from where they left off, enabling multi-turn, long-running conversations.\n* **Reasoning:** Enables the team leader to \"think\" before responding or delegating tasks to team members, and \"analyze\" the results of team members' responses.\n* **Knowledge:** If the team needs to search for information, you can add a knowledge base to the team. This is accessible to the team leader.\n* **Memory:** Gives Teams the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.\n* **Tools:** If the team leader needs to be able to use tools directly, you can add tools to the team.\n\n<Note>\n  If you are migrating from Agno v1.x.x, the `mode` parameter has been deprecated. Please see the [Migration Guide](/how-to/v2-migration#teams) for more details on how to migrate your teams.\n</Note>\n\n## When should you use Teams?\n\nWhen should you use Teams?\n\nThe general guideline is to have Agents that are narrow in scope. When you have a complex task that requires a variety of tools or a long list of steps, a Team of single-purpose agents would be a good fit.\n\nIn addition, if a single agent's context limit gets easily exceeded, because of the complexity of the task, a Team would address this by keeping a single agent's context small, becaues it only addresses a part of the task.\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Building Teams\" icon=\"wrench\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/teams/building-teams\">\n    Learn how to build your teams.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Running your Team\" icon=\"user-robot\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/teams/running-teams\">\n    Learn how to run your teams.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Debugging Teams\" icon=\"bug\" iconType=\"duotone\" href=\"/basics/teams/debugging-teams\">\n    Learn how to debug and troubleshoot your teams.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n* View the [`Team` schema reference](/reference/teams/team)\n* View [Use-cases](/examples/use-cases/teams/)\n* View [Usage Examples](/basics/teams/usage/)\n* View a [Teams Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/teams/README.md)",
