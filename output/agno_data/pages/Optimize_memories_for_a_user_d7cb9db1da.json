This approach gives the agent more control and reasoning ability, so it can decide when to store something versus when to search for existing memories.\n\n**When to use Memory Tools:**\n\n* You want the agent to reason about whether something is worth remembering\n* You need fine-grained control over memory operations (create, update, delete separately)\n* You're building a system where the agent should explicitly search memories rather than having them auto-loaded",
