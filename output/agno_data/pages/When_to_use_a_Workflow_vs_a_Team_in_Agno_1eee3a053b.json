Each is suited for different kinds of use-cases.\n\n## Use a Workflow when:\n\nYou need **orchestrated, multi-step execution** with flexible control flow and a predictable outcome.\n\nWorkflows are ideal for:\n\n* **Sequential processes** - Step-by-step agent executions with dependencies\n* **Parallel execution** - Running independent tasks simultaneously\n* **Conditional logic** - Dynamic routing based on content analysis\n* **Quality assurance** - Iterative loops with end conditions\n* **Complex pipelines** - Mixed components (agents, teams, functions) with branching\n* **Structured processes** - Data transformation with predictable patterns\n\n[Learn more about Workflows](/basics/workflows/overview)\n\n## Use an Agent Team when:\n\nYour task requires reasoning, collaboration, or multi-tool decision-making.\n\nAgent Teams are best for:\n\n* Research and planning\n* Tasks where agents divide responsibilities\n\n[Learn more about Agent Teams](/basics/teams/overview)\n\n> Think of **Workflows** as assembly lines for known tasks,\n> and **Agent Teams** as collaborative task forces for solving open-ended problems.",
