With `respond_directly=True`, the selected agent responds directly without the team leader processing the response.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a Python file\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Add the following code to your Python file\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Snippet file=\"create-venv-step.mdx\" />\n\n<Step title=\"Install libraries\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Export your OpenAI API key\">\n    <CodeGroup>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Run Team\">\n    <CodeGroup>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Find All Cookbooks\">\n    Explore all the available cookbooks in the Agno repository.
