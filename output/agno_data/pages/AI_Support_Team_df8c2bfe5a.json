This example demonstrates advanced routing with knowledge bases and external integrations.\n\nBy building this team, you'll understand:\n\n* How to create a routing system that classifies and directs customer inquiries\n* How to integrate knowledge bases with vector search for documentation assistance\n* How to connect external tools like Slack for escalation and feedback workflows\n* How to combine multiple specialized agents with distinct responsibilities\n\nBuild customer support platforms, help desk systems, technical documentation assistants, or automated ticketing systems.\n\nThe team uses intelligent routing to direct inquiries to specialized agents:\n\n1. **Classify**: Team leader analyzes the inquiry type (question, bug, feedback)\n2. **Route**: Directs to appropriate agent based on classification\n3. **Process**: Specialized agent handles the inquiry with their tools\n4. **Integrate**: Connects with external systems (Slack, knowledge base)\n5. **Respond**: Provides professional response back to the user\n\nEach agent has specific tools and instructions for their domain of responsibility.\n\n```python ai_support_team.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge\nfrom agno.knowledge.reader.website_reader import WebsiteReader\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.exa import ExaTools\nfrom agno.tools.slack import SlackTools\nfrom agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector\n\nknowledge = Knowledge(\n    vector_db=PgVector(\n        table_name=\"website_documents\",\n        db_url=\"postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai\",\n    ),\n)\n\nknowledge.add_content(\n    url=\"https://docs.agno.com/introduction\",\n    reader=WebsiteReader(\n        # Number of links to follow from the seed URLs\n        max_links=10,\n    ),\n)\nsupport_channel = \"testing\"\nfeedback_channel = \"testing\"\n\ndoc_researcher_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Doc researcher Agent\",\n    role=\"Search the knowledge base for information\",\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o\"),\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), ExaTools()],\n    knowledge=knowledge,\n    search_knowledge=True,\n    instructions=[\n        \"You are a documentation expert for given product.
