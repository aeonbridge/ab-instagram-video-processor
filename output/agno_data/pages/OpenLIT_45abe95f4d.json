By integrating Agno with OpenLIT, you can automatically instrument your agents to gain full visibility into LLM calls, tool usage, costs, performance metrics, and errors.\n\n1. **Install Dependencies**\n\nEnsure you have the necessary packages installed:\n\n2. **Deploy OpenLIT**\n\nOpenLIT is open-source and self-hosted. Quick start with Docker:\n\nAccess the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` with default credentials (username: `user@openlit.io`, password: `openlituser`).\n\n**Other Deployment Options:**\n\nFor production deployments, Kubernetes with Helm, or other infrastructure setups, see the [OpenLIT Installation Guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/openlit/installation) for detailed instructions on:\n\n* Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts\n   * Custom Docker configurations\n   * Reusing existing ClickHouse or OpenTelemetry Collector infrastructure\n   * OpenLIT Operator for zero-code instrumentation in Kubernetes\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**\n\nConfigure the OTLP endpoint based on your deployment:\n\n## Sending Traces to OpenLIT\n\n### Example: Basic Agent Setup\n\nThis example demonstrates how to instrument your Agno agent with OpenLIT for automatic tracing.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport openlit\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools",
