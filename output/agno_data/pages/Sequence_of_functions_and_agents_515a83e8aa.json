This shows how to mix different component types for\nmaximum flexibility in your workflow design.\n\n**When to use**: Linear processes where you need custom data preprocessing between AI agents,\nor when combining multiple component types (functions, agents, teams) in sequence.\n\n```python sequence_of_functions_and_agents.py theme={null}\nfrom textwrap import dedent\n\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepInput, StepOutput\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
