By doing this, you will be able to use all features that depend on having a database, without having to set one up.\n\n<Warning>\n  Using the In-Memory storage is not recommended for production applications.\n  Use it for demos, testing and any other use case where you don't want to setup a database.\n</Warning>\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.in_memory import InMemoryDb",
