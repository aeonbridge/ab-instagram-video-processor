This gives more flexibility but requires the agent to make intelligent decisions about what to remember.\n\n**Best for:** Complex workflows, multi-turn interactions where the agent needs to decide what's worth remembering based on context.\n\n<Note>\n  **Important:** Don't enable both `enable_user_memories` and `enable_agentic_memory` at the same time, as they're mutually exclusive. While nothing will break if you set both, `enable_agentic_memory` will always take precedence and `enable_user_memories` will be ignored.\n</Note>\n\n## Storage: Where Memories Live\n\nMemories are stored in the database you connect to your agent. Agno supports all major database systems: Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, and more. Check the [Storage documentation](/basics/database/overview) for the full list of supported databases and setup instructions.\n\nBy default, memories are stored in the `agno_memories` table (or collection, for document databases). If this table doesn't exist when your agent first tries to store a memory, Agno creates it automatically with no manual schema setup required.\n\n### Custom Table Names\n\nYou can specify a custom table name for storing memories:",
