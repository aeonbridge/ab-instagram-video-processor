Consider these as possible next steps to extend this system:\n\n* **Specialized Agents**: Create focused agents for crisis detection, competitive analysis, or influencer identification\n* **Alert Integration**: Connect webhooks to Slack, email, or your existing monitoring systems\n* **Visual Analytics**: Build dashboards that consume the API for executive reporting\n* **Multi-Brand Monitoring**: Scale to monitor multiple brands or competitors simultaneously\n\nYou've built a comprehensive social media intelligence system that:\n\n* Combines direct social data with broader web intelligence\n* Provides weighted sentiment analysis with strategic recommendations\n* Serves insights via production-ready AgentOS API\n* Scales from development through enterprise deployment\n\nThis demonstrates Agno's infrastructure-first approach, where your AI agents become immediately deployable services with proper monitoring, scaling, and integration capabilities built-in.",
