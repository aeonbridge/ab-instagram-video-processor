Or you could deploy it to one of the Hosted Platforms like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Render](https://render.com/). For Railway, you can use the [Agent Infra Railway template](/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction) to deploy your AgentOS.\n\n### How to get started\n\n* Clone the template repository and install the dependencies\n* Start with the local setup to ensure everything works end-to-end.\n* Move to the cloud provider of your choice using the provided guides once your local environment is ready.\n\n<Snippet file=\"setup.mdx\" />\n\n<Snippet file=\"create-agent-infra-docker-codebase.mdx\" />\n\nOr, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the template documentation.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  \n</CodeGroup>\n\nAfter creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker",
