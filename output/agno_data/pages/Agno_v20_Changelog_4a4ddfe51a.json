It also introduces the AgentOS, a runtime for agents.\n\nThis is a major rewrite of the Agno library and introduces various new concepts and updates to the existing ones.\n\nSome of the major changes are:\n\n* Agents, Teams and Workflows are now fully stateless.\n* Knowledge is now a single solution that supports many forms of content.\n* Storage of sessions, memories, evals, etc. has been simplified\n\n<Accordion title=\"Repo Updates\">\n  * `/libs/agno` has been restructured to fit the new concepts in Agno and for better organization.\n  * All code related to managing workspaces and agent deployment in Agno has been moved to a new package called `agno-infra`. This is a combination of the previous `agno-aws` and `agno-docker` packages, as well as the CLI and other tools.\n  * `agno-aws` and `agno-docker` packages have been deprecated and will no-longer be maintained.\n  * All code related to the Agno CLI (`ag`) has been moved to this new `agno-infra` package.\n  * Added `AgentOS` to `agno` as a comprehensive API solution for building multi-agent systems. This also replaces `Playground` and other Apps. See details below.\n  * Cookbook has been completely restructured, with new and more valuable READMEs, better coverage of concepts, and more examples.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"AgentOS\">\n  * Introducing `AgentOS`, a system for hosting agents, teams and workflows as a production-ready API. See full details in the [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) section.\n  * This adds routes for session management, memory management, knowledge management, evals management, and metrics.\n  * This enables you to host agents, teams and workflows, and use the [Agent OS UI](https://os.agno.com) to manage them.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Apps Deprecations\">\n  * Removed `Playground`. Its functionality has been replaced by `AgentOS`.\n  * Removed `AGUIApp` and replace with `AGUI` interface on `AgentOS`.\n  * Removed `SlackApi` and replace with `Slack` interface on `AgentOS`.\n  * Removed `WhatsappApi` and replace with `Whatsapp` interface on `AgentOS`.\n  * Removed `FastAPIApp`. Its functionality has been replaced by `AgentOS`.\n  * `DiscordClient` has been moved to `/integrations/discord`.\n</Accordion>\n\n## Session & Run State\n\n* We have made significant changes to the innerworkings of `Agent`, `Team` and `Workflow` to make them completely stateless.\n* This means that `agent_session`, `session_metrics`, `session_state`, etc. should not be seen as stateful variables that would be updated during the course of a run, but rather as \"defaults\" for the agent if they can be set on initialisation.\n* `CustomEvent` is now supported and you can inherit from it to create your own custom events that can be yielded from your own tools. See the [documentation](/basics/agents/running-agents#custom-events) for more details.\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Run Objects\">\n  For agents:\n\n* `RunResponse` -> `RunOutput`\n  * `RunResponseStartedEvent` -> `RunStartedEvent`\n  * `RunResponseContentEvent` -> `RunContentEvent`\n  * `RunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `RunCompletedEvent`\n  * `IntermediateRunResponseContentEvent` -> `IntermediateRunContentEvent`\n  * `RunResponseErrorEvent` -> `RunErrorEvent`\n  * `RunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `RunCancelledEvent`\n\n* `TeamRunResponse` -> `TeamRunOutput`\n  * `RunResponseStartedEvent` -> `RunStartedEvent`\n  * `RunResponseContentEvent` -> `RunContentEvent`\n  * `RunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `RunCompletedEvent`\n  * `IntermediateRunResponseContentEvent` -> `IntermediateRunContentEvent`\n  * `RunResponseErrorEvent` -> `RunErrorEvent`\n  * `RunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `RunCancelledEvent`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponse` -> `WorkflowRunOutput`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponseStartedEvent` -> `WorkflowRunStartedEvent`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponseContentEvent` -> `WorkflowRunContentEvent`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `WorkflowRunCompletedEvent`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponseErrorEvent` -> `WorkflowRunErrorEvent`\n\n* `WorkflowRunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `WorkflowRunCancelledEvent`\n\n* The import location for `RunOutput` (and events) has been moved to `agno.run.agent`.\n\n* For `RunOutput`, `TeamRunOutput` and `WorkflowRunOutput` the `extra_data` attribute has been removed and the internal attributes are now top-level. This is `references`, `additional_input`, `reasoning_steps`, and `reasoning_messages`.\n\n* `metadata` added to `RunOutput`, `TeamRunOutput` and `WorkflowRunOutput`. This represents all the set metadata for the run.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Session Objects\">\n  * Session storage now stores `AgentSession`, `TeamSession` and `WorkflowSession` with new schemas. See full details in the [Session](/basics/sessions/overview) section.\n  * Session objects now have `runs` directly on it.\n  * Session objects support new convenience methods:\n    * `get_run` -> Get a specific run by ID.\n    * `get_session_summary` -> Get the session summary.\n    * `get_chat_history` -> Get an aggregated view of all messages for all runs in the session.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Metrics\">\n  * `SessionMetrics` and `MessageMetrics` have been unified as a single `Metrics` class.\n  * `audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_total_tokens`.\n  * `input_audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_input_tokens`.\n  * `output_audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_output_tokens`.\n  * `cached_tokens` has been renamed to `cache_read_tokens`.\n  * `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` have been removed (only `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` should be used)\n  * `prompt_tokens_details` and `completion_tokens_details` have been removed. Instead `provider_metrics` captures any provider-specific metrics.\n  * `time` has been renamed to `duration`.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Cancelling Runs\">\n  * You can now cancel a run by calling `cancel_run` on the `Agent`, `Team` or `Workflow`.\n  * This will cancel the run and return a `RunCancelledEvent` during streaming, or set the `RunOutput.status` to `\"cancelled\"`.\n</Accordion>\n\n* `Agent`, `Team`, `Workflow` and the various evals now all support a single `db` parameter. This is to enable storage for the instance of that class. This is required for persistence of sessions, memories, metrics, etc.\n* `storage` and `memory` have been removed from `Agent`, `Team` and `Workflow`.\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Storage Classes\">\n  - This means all previous storage providers have been reworked. Also session storage, memory storage and eval storage are all a single solution now referred to as a \"DB\".\n  - `PostgresStorage` -> `PostgresDb`\n  - `SqliteStorage` -> `SqliteDb`\n  - `MysqlStorage` -> `MysqlDb`\n  - `RedisStorage` -> `RedisDb`\n  - `MongoStorage` -> `MongoDb`\n  - `DynamoDBStorage` -> `DynamoDb`\n  - `SingleStoreStorage` -> `SingleStoreDb`\n  - `InMemoryStorage` -> `InMemoryDb`\n  - `JsonStorage` -> `JsonDb`\n  - `GCSJsonStorage` -> `GCSJsonDb`\n</Accordion>\n\n* With the above changes to storage, memory has been simplified.\n* `memory` has been removed from `Agent` and `Team`. Instead memory is enabled with `enable_user_memories: bool` (like before) and persisted in the `db` instance.\n* Changes to how memories are created can still be done by overriding the `MemoryManager` class on `Agent` or `Team`. E.g. `Agent(memory_manager=MyMemoryManager())`.\n* `AgentMemory` and `TeamMemory` have been removed.\n\n* Knowledge has been completely reworked. See full details in the [Knowledge](/basics/knowledge/) section.\n* You now define a single `Knowledge` instance for all types of content. Files (PDF, CSV, etc.), URLs, and other.\n* The agent can still use your knowledge base to search for information at runtime. All existing RAG implementations are still supported.\n* Added **full `async` support** for embedding models and vector DBs. This has a significant impact on performance and is a major speed improvement when adding content to the knowledge base using `knowledge.add_content_async(...)`.\n* `AgentKnowledge` and all other knowledge base classes have been removed.\n* Import locations for `embedder`, `document`, `chunking`, `reranker` and `reader` have been moved to `agno.knowledge`. See [examples](/basics/knowledge/overview) for more details.\n\n* General:\n  * Since Agents and Teams are now stateless, using attributes from the agent/team object inside a function will give you access to the attributes set on initialisation of that agent/team. E.g. `agent.session_state` should not be used, instead `session_state` can now be directly accessed and would have the \"current\" state of the session.\n  * A new flow allows images, audio and video files generated during tool execution to be passed back in a `FunctionExecutionResult` object and this will ensure these artifacts are made available to the model and agent as needed.\n* All tools that handle media (e.g. image generation tools) now correctly add this generated media to the `RunOutput`, but also make it available for subsequent model calls.\n* The interface of almost all the toolkits have been updated for a more consistent experience around switching specific tools on and off. The list of changes is too long to list here. We suggest you take a look at the toolkits you use specifically and how they have been updated.\n* `show_results` is now `True` by default for all tools. If you just set `stop_after_tool_call=True` then `show_results` will be automatically set to `True`.\n* `images`, `videos`, `audio` and `files` are now available as parameters to tools. See the [documentation](/basics/tools/overview) for more details.\n\n* **Removed legacy artifact classes**: `ImageArtifact`, `VideoArtifact`, `AudioArtifact`, and `AudioResponse` classes have been completely removed in favor of unified media classes.\n\n#### New Unified Media Architecture\n\n* **Unified `Image` class**: Now serves all use cases (input, output, artifacts) with standardized `content: Optional[bytes]` field for raw image data\n* **Unified `Audio` class**: Replaces both `AudioArtifact` and `AudioResponse` with consistent byte-based content storage and additional fields like `transcript`, `expires_at`, `sample_rate`, and `channels`\n* **Unified `Video` class**: Updated to handle all video use cases with standardized content handling and metadata fields\n* **Enhanced `File` class**: Updated to work seamlessly across agent, team, workflow, and toolkit contexts\n\n#### New Methods and Features\n\n* **`from_base64()` class method**: Added to `Image`, `Audio`, and `Video` classes for creating instances from base64-encoded content (automatically converts to raw bytes)\n* **`get_content_bytes()` method**: Retrieves content as raw bytes, handling loading from URLs or file paths\n* **`to_base64()` method**: Converts content to base64 string for transmission/storage\n* **`to_dict()` method**: Enhanced serialization with optional base64 content inclusion\n\n#### Content Standardization\n\n* **Byte-based storage**: All media content is now stored as raw bytes (`Optional[bytes]`) instead of mixed string/bytes formats\n* **Automatic validation**: Model validators ensure exactly one content source (`url`, `filepath`, or `content`) is provided\n* **Auto-generated IDs**: Media objects automatically generate UUIDs when not provided\n\n* Added support for custom loggers. See the [documentation](/basics/custom-logging) for more details.\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Agent Class\">\n  * `agent_id` -> `id` -> If `id` is not set, it is autogenerated using the `name` of the agent, or a random UUID if the `name` is not set.\n  * `search_previous_sessions_history` -> `search_session_history`\n  * `context` -> `dependencies`\n  * `add_context` -> `add_dependencies_to_context`\n  * `add_history_to_messages` -> `add_history_to_context`\n  * `add_name_to_instructions` -> `add_name_to_context`\n  * `add_datetime_to_instructions` -> `add_datetime_to_context`\n  * `add_location_to_instructions` -> `add_location_to_context`\n  * `add_messages` -> `additional_input`\n  * `extra_data` -> `metadata`\n  * `create_default_system_message` -> `build_context`\n  * `create_default_user_message` -> `build_user_context`\n  * Added `send_media_to_model` -> `True` by default. Set to False if you don't want to send media (image, audio, video, files) to the model.  This is useful if you only want media for tools.\n  * Added `store_media` -> `True` by default. Set to False if you don't want to store any media in the `RunOutput` that is persisted with sessions.\n  * `num_history_responses` -> `num_history_runs`\n  * Removed `success_criteria` and `goal`\n  * Removed `team_session_id` and `workflow_session_id`.\n  * Removed `introduction`\n  * Removed `show_tool_calls` -> This is now just always enabled.\n  * Removed `team` and `team_data`\n  * Removed `respond_directly`, `add_transfer_instructions`, `team_response_separator` and `team_session_id` (since team has been removed from `Agent`)\n  * Removed all `team` functionality from inside `Agent` (i.e. the deprecated teams implementation has been removed)\n  * Removed all `monitoring` from `Agent`. With the new AgentOS platform, monitoring is done using your own data. Go to [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) to get started.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Input & Output\">\n  * `response_model` -> `output_schema`\n  * Added `input_schema` (a pydantic model) to validate the input to the agent.\n  * Changed `message` to `input` (which also replaces `messages`). `input` can be of type `str`, `list`, `dict`, `Message`, `BaseModel`, or `list[Message]`.\n  * If a `dict` and `input_schema` is provided, the dict will be validated against the schema.\n  * If a `BaseModel` and `input_schema` is provided, the model will be validated against the schema.\n  * `arun` and `acontinue_run` with `stream=True` now return an async iterator of `RunOutputEvent` directly and is not a coroutine anymore.\n  * `debug_mode: bool` added to `run`, `arun`, `print_response` and `aprint_response` to enable debug mode for a specific run.\n  * `add_history_to_context` added to `run`, `arun`, `print_response` and `aprint_response` to add the chat history to the context for the current run.\n  * `dependencies` added to `run`, `arun`, `print_response` and `aprint_response` to add dependencies to the context for the current run.\n  * `metadata` added to `run`, `arun`, `print_response` and `aprint_response` to set the metadata for the current run. This is merged with the metadata set on the `Team` object.\n  * Added `get_run_output` and `get_last_run_output` to `Agent` to retrieve a run output by ID.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Metrics\">\n  * Metrics have been simplified and cleaned up.\n  * There are now 3 levels of metrics:\n    * `Message.metrics` -> Metrics for each message (assistant, tool, etc.).\n    * `RunOutput.metrics` -> Aggregated metrics for the whole run.\n    * `AgentSession.metrics` -> Aggregated metrics for the whole session.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Knowledge\">\n  * `knowledge` is now an instance of `Knowledge` instead of `AgentKnowledge`.\n  * `retriever` -> `knowledge_retriever` -> For a custom retriever.\n  * `add_references` -> `add_knowledge_to_context` -> To enable traditional RAG.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Memory\">\n  * `add_memory_references` -> `add_memories_to_context`\n  * You can set a custom `memory_manager` to use when creating memories.\n  * Added `get_user_memories` to retrieve the user memories.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Sessions\">\n  * `add_session_summary_references` -> `add_session_summary_to_context`\n  * You can set a custom `session_summary_manager` to use when creating session summaries.\n  * Removed `session_name` and replace with functions `get_session_name` and `rename_session`.\n  * Added `get_session` to retrieve a session by ID.\n  * Added `get_chat_history` to retrieve the chat history from a session.\n  * Added `get_session_metrics` to retrieve the metrics for a session.\n  * Added `get_session_state` to retrieve the session state from a session.\n  * Added `get_session_summary` to retrieve the session summary from a session.\n  * Because `Agent` is now stateless, `agent_session`, `session_metrics`, `run_id`, `run_input`, `run_messages` and `run_response` as \"sticky\" agent attributes have been removed.\n  * Because `Agent` is now stateless, `images`, `videos`, `audio` are no longer available as agent attributes. Instead these can be accessed on the `RunOutput` for a particular run.\n  * Removed `team_session_state` and `workflow_session_state`. Only `session_state` is used.\n  * Added `enable_agentic_state` to `Agent` and `Team` to allow the agent to update the session state with a tool call.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Updates to Team Class\">\n  * Removed `mode` from `Team`. Instead there are attributes that can be used to control the behavior of the team:\n    * `respond_directly` -> If True, the team leader won't process responses from the members and instead will return them directly\n    * `delegate_to_all_members` -> If True, the team leader will delegate tasks to all members simultaneously, instead of one by one. When running async (using `arun`) members will run concurrently.\n    * `determine_input_for_members` -> `True` by default. Set to False if you want to send the run input directly to the member agents without the team leader synthesizing its own input.\n  * `team_id` -> `id` -> If `id` is not set, it is autogenerated using the `name` of the team, or a random UUID if the `name` is not set.\n  * `search_previous_sessions_history` -> `search_session_history`\n  * `context` -> `dependencies`\n  * `add_context` -> `add_dependencies_to_context`\n  * `add_history_to_messages` -> `add_history_to_context`\n  * `add_name_to_instructions` -> `add_name_to_context`\n  * `add_datetime_to_instructions` -> `add_datetime_to_context`\n  * `add_location_to_instructions` -> `add_location_to_context`\n  * `add_member_tools_to_system_message` -> `add_member_tools_to_context`\n  * `extra_data` -> `metadata`\n  * Added `additional_input` (works the same as for `Agent`)\n  * Added `store_member_responses: bool` to optionally store the member responses on the team run output object.\n  * Added `acli_app` to `Team` to enable the CLI app for the team in async mode.\n  * Added `send_media_to_model` -> `True` by default.
