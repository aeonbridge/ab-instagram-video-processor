Take a look at the [compatibility matrix](/basics/models/compatibility#multimodal-support) to see which models support image as output.\n\n## Image Output Modality\n\nThe following example demonstrates how some models can directly generate images as part of their response.\n\n```python image_agent.py theme={null}\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nfrom agno.agent import Agent, RunOutput  # noqa\nfrom agno.models.google import Gemini\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=Gemini(\n        id=\"gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation\",\n        response_modalities=[\"Text\", \"Image\"], # Generate both images and text in the response\n    )\n)",
