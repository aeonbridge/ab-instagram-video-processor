  "content": "Source: https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/mcp/tools\n\nLearn how to use MCPTools in the Agents, Teams and Workflows within your AgentOS\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) enables Agents to interact with external systems through a standardized interface.\n\nYou can give your Agents access to MCP tools using the `MCPTools` class. Read more about using MCP tools [here](/basics/tools/mcp/overview).\n\nYour `MCPTools` will work normally within AgentOS. Their lifecycle is automatically handled, you don't need to handle their connection and disconnection.\n\n<Note>\n  If you are using `MCPTools` within AgentOS, you should not use `reload=True` when serving your AgentOS.\n  This can break the MCP connection during the FastAPI lifecycle.\n</Note>\n\n```python mcp_tools_example.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.os import AgentOS\nfrom agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools",
