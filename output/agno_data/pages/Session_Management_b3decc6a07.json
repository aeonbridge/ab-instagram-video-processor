Wrap `set_session_name` in your own helper before exposing it to end-users\n\n### Auto-generated Names\n\nLet the AI generate meaningful names from conversation content:\n\nCalling `set_session_name(autogenerate=True)` asks the model to read the first few messages in the session and generate a short (≤5 words) label. The method returns the updated session object. Use `get_session_name()` to retrieve the generated name.\n\n* **Delay generation** until the conversation has meaningful context (e.g., after 2–3 messages)\n* **Provide a fallback**: wrap the call in your own helper that falls back to a human-entered name or a ticket ID if the generation fails\n* **Batch jobs**: loop over session IDs from your database and call `set_session_name(..., autogenerate=True)` once for each. The API is synchronous, so plan around model latency\n* **Costs**: Each generation is an extra model call. Use cheaper models via `session_summary_manager` or run it out-of-band if you're cost sensitive\n\nSession caching stores the session object in memory to improve performance. `cache_session=True` keeps the hydrated session object in memory after the first database read, avoiding extra queries for subsequent runs.\n\n* **Many sequential turns** in the same session (support chats, copilots, etc.)\n* **Latency-sensitive** deployments where every DB round trip matters\n* **Resource-heavy databases** (remote Postgres, serverless drivers) where connection setup dominates\n\n<Warning>\n  This is only for development and testing purposes. It is not recommended for production use.\n</Warning>",
