Increase to 10-15 for complex multi-step tasks. Monitor\n  with `show_full_reasoning=True` to see how many steps your agent actually\n  needs.\n</Tip>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n* View [Reasoning Agent Examples](/basics/reasoning/usage/agents/basic-cot)\n* View [Reasoning Agent Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/reasoning/agents)\n* View [Reasoning Team Examples](/basics/reasoning/usage/agents/team-cot)\n* View [Reasoning Team Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/cookbook/reasoning/teams)",
