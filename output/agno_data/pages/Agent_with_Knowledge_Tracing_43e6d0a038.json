The traces capture knowledge searches, model calls, and all agent operations.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a Python file\">\n    \n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Add the following code to your Python file\">\n    python\n            from agno.agent import Agent\n            from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\n\nagent = Agent(tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()])\n\n# Perform a web search and capture the response\n            response = agent.run(\"What's happening in France?\")\n    `\n    </Step>\n\n<Snippet file=\"create-venv-step.mdx\" />\n\n<Step title=\"Install libraries\">\n    `\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Export your API keys\">\n    <CodeGroup>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Start PostgreSQL with pgvector\">\n    Make sure you have PostgreSQL running with pgvector extension.
