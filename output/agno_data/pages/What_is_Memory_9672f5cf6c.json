This is the power of Memory in Agno.\n\nWhen relevant information appears in a conversation, like a user's name, preferences, or habits, an Agent with Memory automatically stores it in your database. Later, when that information becomes relevant again, the agent retrieves and uses it naturally in the conversation. The agent is effectively **learning about each user** across interactions.\n\n<Tip>\n  **Memory ≠ Session History:** Memory stores learned user facts (\"Sarah prefers email\"), [session history](/basics/chat-history/overview) stores conversation messages for continuity (\"what did we just discuss?\").\n</Tip>\n\n## Getting Started with Memory\n\nSetting up memory is straightforward: just connect a database and enable the memory feature. Here's a basic setup:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb",
