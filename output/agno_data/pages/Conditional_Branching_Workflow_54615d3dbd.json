Unlike Conditions which can trigger multiple\nparallel paths, Router selects exactly one path.\n\n```python router_steps_workflow.py theme={null}\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom agno.agent.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.router import Router\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepInput\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
