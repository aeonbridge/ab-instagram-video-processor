This pattern provides clear step identification and enhanced logging\nwhile maintaining simple sequential execution.\n\n## Pattern: Sequential Named Steps\n\n**When to use**: Linear processes where you want clear step identification, better logging,\nand future platform support. Ideal when you have distinct phases that benefit from naming.\n\n```python sequence_of_steps.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
