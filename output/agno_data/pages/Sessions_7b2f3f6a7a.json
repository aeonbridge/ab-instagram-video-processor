The agent responds to your message and that's it - no memory of what just happened.\n\nBut most real applications need **conversations**, not just one-off exchanges. That's where sessions come in.\n\nThink of a session as a conversation thread. It's a collection of back-and-forth interactions (called \"runs\") between a user and your Agent, Team, or Workflow. Each session gets a unique `session_id` that ties together all the runs, chat history, state, and metrics for that conversation.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* **Session**: A multi-turn conversation identified by a `session_id`. Contains all the runs, history, state, and metrics for that conversation thread.\n* **Run**: A single interaction within a session. Every time you call `Agent.run()`, `Team.run()`, or `Workflow.run()`, a new `run_id` is created. Think of it as one message-and-response pair in the conversation.\n\n<Note>\n  Sessions require a database to store history and state. See [Session Storage](/basics/database/overview) for setup details.\n</Note>\n\n<Note>\n  **Workflow sessions work differently:** Unlike agent and team sessions that store conversation messages, workflow sessions track complete pipeline executions (runs) with inputs and outputs. Because of these unique characteristics, we've created a [dedicated Workflow Sessions section](/basics/sessions/workflow-sessions) that covers workflow-specific features like run-based history, session state, and workflow agents.\n</Note>\n\n## Single-Run Example\n\nWhen you run an agent without specifying a `session_id`, Agno automatically generates both a `run_id` and a `session_id` for you:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\n\nagent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o-mini\"))",
