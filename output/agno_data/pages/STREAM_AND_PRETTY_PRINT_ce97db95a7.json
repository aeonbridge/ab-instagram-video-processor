I.e. this team is a \"passthrough\" team (or \"router\" team).\n\nIn that case the team leader is effectively bypassed and all communication is directly with a team member. See the [Passthrough Teams](/basics/teams/delegation#passthrough-teams) section for more details.\n\nNext, continue building your team by adding functionality as needed. Common questions:\n\n* **How do I run my team?** -> See the [running teams](/basics/teams/running-teams) documentation.\n* **How do I add history to my team?** -> See the [chat history](/basics/chat-history/team/overview) documentation.\n* **How do I manage sessions?** -> See the [sessions](/basics/sessions/overview) documentation.\n* **How do I manage input and capture output?** -> See the [input and output](/basics/input-output/overview) documentation.\n* **How do I manage the team context?** -> See the [context engineering](/basics/context/team) documentation.\n* **How do I add knowledge?** -> See the [knowledge](/basics/knowledge/overview) documentation.\n* **How do I add guardrails?** -> See the [guardrails](/basics/guardrails/overview) documentation.\n* **How do I cache responses during development?** -> See the [response caching](/basics/models/cache-response) documentation.",
