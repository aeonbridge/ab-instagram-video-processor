Those vectors make it easy to store and search information semantically—so you find content by intent and context, not just exact keywords.\n\nIf you're building features like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic search, question answering over docs, or long-term memory for agents, embedders are the foundation that makes it all work.\n\n### Why use embedders?\n\n* **Better recall than keywords**: They understand meaning, so \"How do I reset my passcode?\" finds docs mentioning \"change PIN\".\n* **Ground LLMs in your data**: Provide the model with trusted, domain-specific context at answer time.\n* **Scale to large knowledge bases**: Vectors enable fast similarity search across thousands or millions of chunks.\n* **Multilingual retrieval**: Many embedders map different languages to the same semantic space.\n\n### When to use embedders\n\nUse embedders when you need any of the following:\n\n* **RAG and context injection**: Supply relevant snippets to your agent before responding.\n* **Semantic search**: Let users query by meaning across product docs, wikis, tickets, or chats.\n* **Deduplication and clustering**: Group similar content or avoid repeating the same info.\n* **Personal and team memory**: Store summaries and facts for later recall by agents.\n\nYou probably don’t need embedders when your dataset is tiny (a handful of pages) and simple keyword search already works well.\n\n### How it works in Agno\n\nAgno uses `OpenAIEmbedder` as the default, but you can swap in any supported embedder. When you add content to a knowledge base, the embedder converts each chunk into a vector and stores it in your vector database. Later, when an agent searches, it embeds the query and finds the most similar vectors.\n\nHere's a basic setup:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge\nfrom agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector\nfrom agno.knowledge.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder",
