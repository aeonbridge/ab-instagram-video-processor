They are setup to run locally using docker and on cloud providers. They're a fantastic starting point and are used by various companies using Agno. You'll definitely need to customize them to fit your specific needs, but they'll get you started much faster.\n\nAgno currently supports the following templates:\n\nDocker: [agent-infra-docker](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker)\nAWS: [agent-infra-aws](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws)\nRailway: [agent-infra-railway](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-railway)\n\n* [Modal](https://modal.com/)\n* [Render](https://render.com/)\n* [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)\n* [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)\n\nAdditionally, all templates contain a dev and prd environment. The dev environment is used for development and testing. The prd environment is used for production. We recommend using docker for the dev environment for most use cases and selecting a cloud provider of your choice for the prd environment.\n\n## How to get started with a template:\n\n1. Make sure you have the agno and agno-infra installed.\n\n2. Create your codebase using: `ag infra create` and choose a template.\n\n3. `cd` into your codebase and run the dev environment.\n\n4. Run the prd environment after you've tested the dev environment and are ready to deploy to production.\n\n* The instructions for dev and prd environment are different for each template. Please refer to the template documentation for specific instructions.\n* Instead of using `ag infra create`, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the template documentation.\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Agent Infra Docker \" icon=\"server\" href=\"/templates/agent-infra-docker/introduction\">\n    An AgentOS template with Docker compose file.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Agent Infra AWS\" icon=\"server\" href=\"/templates/agent-infra-aws/introduction\">\n    An AgentOS template with AWS infrastructure.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Agent Infra Railway\" icon=\"server\" href=\"/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction\">\n    An AgentOS template with Railway infrastructure.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
