This guide covers advanced patterns for customizing memory behavior, controlling what gets stored, and building complex multi-agent systems with shared memory.\n\n## Customizing the Memory Manager\n\nThe `MemoryManager` controls which LLM creates and updates memories, plus how those memories are generated. You can customize it to use a specific model, add privacy rules, or change how memories are extracted:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.memory import MemoryManager\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat",
