This pattern combines the benefits of named steps with the flexibility of\ncustom functions, allowing for sophisticated data processing within structured workflow steps.\n\n**When to use**: When you need named step organization but want custom logic that goes\nbeyond what agents/teams provide. Ideal for complex data processing, multi-step operations,\nor when you need to orchestrate multiple agents within a single step.\n\n```python step_with_function.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step, StepInput, StepOutput\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
