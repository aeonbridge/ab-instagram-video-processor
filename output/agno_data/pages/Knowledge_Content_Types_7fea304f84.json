Readers are used to parse content from the origin and then chunk it into smaller\npieces that will then be embedded by the VectorDB.\n\nCustom readers or an override to the default reader and/or its settings can be passed when adding the content. In the below example, an instance of the standard `PDFReader` class is created\nbut we update the chunk\\_size. Similarly, we can update the `chunking_strategy` and other parameters that will influence how content is ingested and processed.\n\nFor more information about the different readers and their capabilities checkout the [Readers](/basics/knowledge/readers) page.\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Search & Retrieval\" icon=\"magnifying-glass\" href=\"/basics/knowledge/search-and-retrieval/overview\">\n    Learn how agents search and find information in your knowledge base\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Readers\" icon=\"book-open\" href=\"/basics/knowledge/readers\">\n    Explore content parsing and ingestion options in detail\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Chunking Strategies\" icon=\"scissors\" href=\"/basics/knowledge/chunking/overview\">\n    Optimize how content is broken down for better search results\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Vector Databases\" icon=\"database\" href=\"/basics/vectordb/overview\">\n    Choose the right storage solution for your knowledge base\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
