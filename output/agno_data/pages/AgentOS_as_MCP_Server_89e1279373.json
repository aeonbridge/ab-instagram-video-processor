But you can also expose it as an **MCP server**.\n\nThis is done by setting `enable_mcp_server=True` when creating your AgentOS instance:\n\nThe [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) has become the industry standard to handle connecting AI applications with external tools and data sources.\n\nBy exposing your AgentOS as an MCP server, external clients that can handle MCP-compatible applications will be able to connect to your AgentOS and interact with it.\n\n```python enable_mcp_example.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb\nfrom agno.models.anthropic import Claude\nfrom agno.os import AgentOS\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools",
