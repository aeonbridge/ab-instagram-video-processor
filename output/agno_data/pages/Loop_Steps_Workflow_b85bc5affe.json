Ideal for research\ngathering, data collection, or any process where \"good enough\" is determined by content\nanalysis rather than a fixed number of iterations.\n\n```python loop_steps_workflow.py theme={null}\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow import Loop, Step, Workflow\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepOutput",
