This comprehensive guide covers all workflow types, from simple sequential processes to complex branching logic with parallel execution and dynamic routing.\n\nUnlike free-form agent interactions, these patterns provide structured automation with consistent, repeatable results ideal for production systems.\n\nThe core building blocks of Agno Workflows are:\n\n| Component     | Purpose                         |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| **Step**      | Basic execution unit            |\n| **Agent**     | AI assistant with specific role |\n| **Team**      | Coordinated group of agents     |\n| **Function**  | Custom Python logic             |\n| **Parallel**  | Concurrent execution            |\n| **Condition** | Conditional execution           |\n| **Loop**      | Iterative execution             |\n| **Router**    | Dynamic routing                 |\n\nAgno Workflows support multiple execution patterns that can be combined to build sophisticated automation systems.\nEach pattern serves specific use cases and can be composed together for complex workflows.\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Sequential Workflows\" icon=\"arrow-right\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/sequential\">\n    Linear execution with step-by-step processing\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Parallel Workflows\" icon=\"arrows-split-up-and-left\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/parallel-workflow\">\n    Concurrent execution for independent tasks\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Conditional Workflows\" icon=\"code-branch\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/conditional-workflow\">\n    Branching logic based on conditions\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Iterative Workflows\" icon=\"rotate\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/iterative-workflow\">\n    Loop-based execution with quality controls\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Branching Workflows\" icon=\"sitemap\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/branching-workflow\">\n    Dynamic routing and path selection\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Grouped Steps\" icon=\"layer-group\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/grouped-steps-workflow\">\n    Reusable step sequences and modular design\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Function-Based Workflows\" icon=\"function\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/custom-function-step-workflow\">\n    Pure Python workflows with complete control\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Multi-Pattern Combinations\" icon=\"puzzle-piece\" href=\"/basics/workflows/workflow-patterns/advanced-workflow-patterns\">\n    Complex workflows combining multiple patterns\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
