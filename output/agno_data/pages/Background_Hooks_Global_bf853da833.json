Check the server logs to see the background hooks executing after the response is sent.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n1. The agent processes the request\n2. The response is sent immediately to the user\n3. All pre-hooks and post-hooks run in the background\n4. The user doesn't have to wait for these tasks to complete\n\n<Note>\n  With `run_hooks_in_background=True` on AgentOS, **all** hooks for all agents run in the background. Use the `@hook` decorator for more granular control over which hooks run in the background.\n</Note>",
