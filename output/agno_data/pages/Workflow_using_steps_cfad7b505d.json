This pattern allows you to define reusable step\nsequences and choose which sequences to execute in your workflow.\n\n**When to use**: When you have logical groupings of steps that you want to organize, reuse,\nor selectively execute. Ideal for creating modular workflow components that can be mixed\nand matched based on different scenarios.\n\n```python workflow_using_steps.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.steps import Steps\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
