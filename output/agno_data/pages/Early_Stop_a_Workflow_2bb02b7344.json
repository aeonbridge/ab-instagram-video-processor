Ideal for data\nvalidation pipelines, security checks, quality assurance workflows, or any process where\ncontinuing with invalid inputs could cause problems.\n\n```python early_stop_workflow_with_agents.py theme={null}\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.workflow import Workflow\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepInput, StepOutput",
