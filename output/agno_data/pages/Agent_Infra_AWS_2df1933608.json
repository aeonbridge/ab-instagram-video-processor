This template uses `agno-infra` SDK to manage the local and AWS deployment.\n\n### Local environment\n\nRuns both AgentOS and PostgreSQL using Docker.\n\nIdeal for development, testing, and verifying your setup before deploying to the cloud.\n\nAgentOS is deployed on ECS while the image is built and pushed to AWS ECR.\n\nPostgreSQL is provisioned via RDS for reliable, managed database hosting.\n\nThe template automates infrastructure creation and deployment steps using agno-infra.\n\n### How to get started\n\n* Clone the template repository and install the dependencies\n* Start with the local setup to ensure everything works end-to-end.\n* Move to AWS deployment using the provided guides once your local environment is ready.\n\n<Snippet file=\"setup.mdx\" />\n\n<Snippet file=\"create-agent-infra-aws-codebase.mdx\" />\n\nYou can also clone the template directory and follow the instructions in the template documentation.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  \n</CodeGroup>\n\nAfter creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker.",
