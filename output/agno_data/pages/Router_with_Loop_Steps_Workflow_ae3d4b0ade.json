Ideal for content-adaptive workflows where processing complexity\nshould match content complexity.\n\n```python router_with_loop_steps.py theme={null}\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom agno.agent.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\nfrom agno.workflow.loop import Loop\nfrom agno.workflow.router import Router\nfrom agno.workflow.step import Step\nfrom agno.workflow.types import StepInput, StepOutput\nfrom agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow",
