This is crucial for:\n\n* Validating sensitive operations\n* Reviewing tool calls before execution\n* Gathering user input for decision-making\n* Managing external tool execution\n\n## Types of Human-in-the-Loop Flows\n\nAgno supports four main types of human-in-the-loop flows:\n\n1. **[User Confirmation](/basics/hitl/user-confirmation)**: Require explicit user approval before executing a tool\n2. **[User Input](/basics/hitl/user-input)**: Gather specific information from users during execution\n3. **[Dynamic User Input](/basics/hitl/dynamic-user-input)**: Have the agent collect user input as it needs it\n4. **[External Tool Execution](/basics/hitl/external-execution)**: Execute tools outside of the agent's control\n\n<Note>\n  Currently Agno only supports Human-in flows for `Agent`. `Team` and `Workflow` will be supported in the near future!\n</Note>\n\n## Resolving Human-in-the-Loop Requirements\n\nDuring Human-in-the-Loop flows, the agent run will pause to wait for the user to resolve whatever requirement is needed.\n\nThis is how you can interact with the requirements in your code:\n\n```python  theme={null}",
